## Counting Techniques
	- For an event with multiple independent steps, multiply the number of possible outcomes for each step together to get the number of possible outcomes for the event.
- ## Classical Probability
	- Assuming all outcomes are equally likely, the probability of a given event is the number of outcomes which result in the event divided by the total number of potential outcomes.
	- **Vocabulary**
	  Experiment: The method by which an outcome or observation is obtained.
	  Simple Event: The outcome observed.
	  Compound Event: Collection of simple events.
- ## Discrete Random Variables
	- A random variable is a factor of randomness that impacts the result of the experiment.
	- A discrete random variable can only equate to certain values.
	- Probability distribution is the likely hood of each individual potential outcome, need to add up to 1 or 100%.
- ## Continuous Random Variables
	- A random variable that can take on infinite potential values.
	- Can be graphed with a density curve, which is basically a smooth histogram.
	- Area under the curve must equal one, divide one by the range of x values to get y.
	- For continuous variables, the probability of getting any one exact value is zero due to there being infinite potential values.
- ## Normal Distribution
	- Bell shaped curves are symmetrical, unimodal distributions of values.
	- You can estimate the standard deviation by measuring from the mean to where the curve starts to bow outward.
