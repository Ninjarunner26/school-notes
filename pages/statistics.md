# Statistics
Interpret and infer new information from collected data.
- ## 1. Data Sets
  A data set is the recorded information on which statistical analysis is performed.
- ### 1.1 Population
  The population is the entire group that you are attempting to learn about.
  **Example**
  The population of Canada.
- ### 1.2 Sample
  The sample is the subsection of the population which is studied and on which data is recorded.
  **Example**
  A randomly selected group of people living in Canada.
- ### 1.3 Experimental Unit (individual subject)
  An experimental unit is an individual subject in the sample.
  **Example**
  Any singular person participating in this vague Canada study.
- ### 1.4 Variables
  Variables are the individual data points of the experimental units being recorded.
  **Example**
  Height, eye color, etc.
- #### Quantitative Variables
  Measurable or countable variables, numerical values.
- Discrete - Countable
- Continuous - Measurable
  **Example**
  Distance, temperature, weight, etc.
- #### Qualitative Variables
  Qualities possessed or displayed by an experimental unit, non-numerical values.
  **Example**
  Color, gender, favorite ice cream flavor, etc.
- ## 2. Graphing
  Visually map and represent data.
- ### 2.1 Appropriate Graph Style
  There are many different ways of graphing data, and it is important to choose the style that most clearly depicts the data being presented. One important aspect to consider when making this decision is whether the data is **Quantitative** or **Qualitative**
- #### Options for Quantitative Data
- Bar graph
- Pie chart
- Histogram
- #### Options for Qualitative Data
- Bar graph
- Pie chart
- Pictograph
  
  Note that **bar graphs** and **pie charts** are viable options for either type of data. This is because a slice of the pie or the height of a bar could just as easily be used to represent the number of experimental units that express a given quality as they can be used to represent the numerical value of a given variable.
  
  **Histograms** are only viable for numerical values, as they show the number of data points that have values falling in different ranges, and qualitative variables don't have numerical values that can fit in different ranges.
  
  **Pictographs** on the other hand, while technically capable of displaying either type of data, are ill suited to quantitative data in both their forms, as repeating the image either only allows for the displaying of whole numbers, or at best allows for ambiguous fractions, and scaling the image proportional to other values is just as, if not more, ambiguous.
- ### 2.2 Misleading Graphs
  There are many ways in which graphs can be made to manipulate or mislead by inaccurately displaying data.
  
  You can **suppress** or **truncate** the **zero** by starting a bar graph at a higher value, making the differences between two bars appear bigger.
  
  Related is simply **improper scale** where the size of the graphics doesn't correctly match up  with the data. This can happen on accident when manually making graphs as opposed to using software made for graphing.
  
  **Pictographs** can be misleading when an image is scaled to represent the different values. This is because the area increases significantly faster than the height and it can be unclear which is representing the data. A better solution is to use copies of the image as opposed to scaling.
  
  **Poorly defined categories** can be an issue when the way in which categories are defined skews the data.
  **Example**
  Trying to suggest younger people are better drivers because people under 30 have less accidents than people over 30.
- ### 2.3 Meta data
- #### Measures of center
  **Mean** is the average, calculated by adding all values and dividing by the number of values.
  **Median** is the middle value or average of the two middle values. Find middle value by dividing the number of values + 1 by 2.
  **Range** - difference between max and min values in data set.
  Range is not very useful as it only takes two data points into account and is impacted greatly by outliers.
  
  For skewed distributions, the mean will be closer to the tail than the median.
- #### Measures of variability
  **Measure of spread** - how spread out is data?
  Small spread good when uniformity is desired.
  Large spread good when distinctions need to be made.
  
  **Standard deviation** Average distance of data points from mean.
  Std dev = sqrt((Sum ( given value x * data point i - mean)^2) / sample size)
- #### Measures of relative standing
  **Tchebysheff** - Percentage of data points that fall within a distance of the mean
  1 - ( 1 / # of std devs ^ 2 )
  **Emperical rule** states that for a roughly symmetrical bell-shaped data set, roughly 68% of measurements lie within 1 std dev, 95% within 2, and 99.7% within 3
  
  **Z - Score** - Number of std devs relative to the mean, **ROUND TO 2 DECIMALS**
  (given value - mean) / std dev
