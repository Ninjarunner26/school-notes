## Planning
	- Discover and document what is wanted by the customers
	- Do the requirements seem feasible?
	- Are they verifiable / testable?
- ## Design
	- ### High Level (Architecture)
		- Intended platform, broader view of different components, what external APIS / libraries may be used.
	- ### Low Level
		- Planning of specific components such as classes, interfaces, and database entries, and the ways in which they'll interact.
- ## Development
	- Begin programming according to design specifications.
	- Developers create unit tests for their classes and libraries.
- ## Testing
	- **Function** testing verifies that the program behaves in the expected manor.
	- **Regression** testing is done after bug fixes to ensure they didn't cause issues elsewhere in the program.
	- **Performance** testing is done to make sure that the program works within acceptable time and resource constraints.
	- **Security** testing verifies the software meets security standards.
- ## Deployment
	- The process of setting the program up in production, such as setting up databases on production servers, delivering software packages to users, etc.
- ## Maintenance
	- Patching bugs and performing updates.
